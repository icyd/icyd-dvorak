# IcyD Dvorak keyboard layout

Based on the [Programmer Dvorak](http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/) of Roland Kaufmann.
This layout adds the vocals with acute accent (and Ã±), to be access with Alt+Ctl or
AltGr, on the vocals keys for Spanish's typists.

Number are keep on `shift` modifier, but in `QWERTY` order.
Some symbols are moved in order to have the same bracket/brace/parenthesis on the same fingers, on opposite hands.

Also semicolon and single quote are swapped, as in normal Dvorak layout.

## Linux

To install use the installer bash script `install.sh`. Simply run:

```bash

    sudo sh install.sh --install

To remove use remove use the `--remove` flag. Recommended options for keyboard:
`Option "XkbOptions" "caps:swapescape,lv3:ralt_switch,compose:102,numpad:shift3,keypad:hex"`
