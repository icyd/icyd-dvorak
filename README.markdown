# IcyD Dvorak keyboard layout
Based on the [Programmer Dvorak]http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/ of Roland Kaufmann.
This layout only add the vocals with acute accent, to be access with Alt+Ctl or
AltGr, on the vocals keys for Spanish's typists.

Also will include another personal modifications.

*NOTE:* For linux, Programmer Dvorak needs to be installed on the system.
